Queue (First in First Out (FIFO))

Queue is a data structure that is just an array or linked list contained within a class.

Imagine a line of people at a grocery store. The first person in line is the next person to be serviced. You wouldn't service the last person in line first.

-new items are added to the back of the queue (end of array)
-items are only removed from the front of the queue (front of array)
