Stack (Last in First Out (LIFO))

Stack is a data structure that is just an array or linked list contained within a class.

Imagine a stack of heavy blocks. You would only add new blocks to the top of the stack and remove blocks from the top of the stack because they are too heavy to remove from the middle or the bottom.

So, to remove the block at the bottom of the stack, you would first remove blocks at the top one-by-one until you got to the bottom

-new items are added to the 'top' of the 'stack'
    -added to the back of the array
-items are only removed from the 'top' of the 'stack' 
  -removed from the back of the array
